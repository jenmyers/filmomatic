# The Film-O-Matic

Do you like your film super independent? Do you want to help an aspiring filmmaker bring their vision to the screen? Do you like clicking big, bright buttons? The Film-O-Matic allows you to get information about a random (within a fairly small sample size) narrative film Kickstarter project with a link to its fundraising page so that you can support the cause.

## Kickstarter API

The Kickstarter API is private, but with a valid Kickstarter account you can query project information. I used the [Kickscraper gem](https://github.com/markolson/kickscraper) to access what I needed.

## Other tools

Also made possible with: [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/), [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), [Typekit](http://typekit.com/) and [Enytpo](http://entypo.com/).

## Tasks

- Add some responsive design magic.
